I love it at Luno, and I think you would probably too, so get in touch if I know you and you want a referral, if not check out the [careers page](https://www.luno.com/en/careers) and if you get hired, come say hi.

Did some Hackathons, as an individual in [#hackbehaviour](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/offerzen-hackathon-building-root-apps-to-hackbehaviour) and with a team for [an insurance hackathon](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/sandbox-for-insurtech-bridging-the-gap-between-insurers-and-innovators).

Mantain a small static site for [She is Strong](http://sheisstrong.org/), helping however I can.
