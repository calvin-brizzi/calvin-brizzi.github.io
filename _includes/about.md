#### tl;dr

I love it at Luno, and I think you would probably too, so get in touch if I know you and you want a referral, if not check out the [careers page](https://www.luno.com/en/careers) and if you get hired, come say hi.

Completed internships at Facebook (twice), Amazon and BrandsEye.

Used to be chairperson of the [UCT Dev Soc](https://www.facebook.com/groups/uctdev/), a tutor for the Computer Science Department and did some freelance work for the [Percy Fitzpatrick Institute](http://kysabymf.herokuapp.com/).
