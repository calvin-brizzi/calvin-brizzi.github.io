# So you want a static website

You need a free static website for some reason? Cool, let's see if I can help.

I'm going to list some options for the hosting and then my recommendation for the building.

### UCT Computer Science Student

If you're a UCT Computer Science student, you can host a website super low effort by dropping the necessary files into a public_html folder in your home directory on the nightmare server. This will create people.cs.uct.ac.za/~*yourstudentnumber*.

### GitHub Pages

GitHub (which you really should be using anyway), will host a free static website for you, in the form *yourusername*.github.io. This website you're looking at is hosted on github pages (with my own domain name), so this is proof it works. It's a little more work than the above, but I personally prefer the url it provides.

It also means any edits you make contribute to your Github contributions, those sweet green blocks. Finally you can make small changes directly from within GitHub.

### Neocities

Haven't tried this myself, but it's a Geocities clone. Site size limit is 20 Mb as far as I know, but you should be able to stay under it. You get a yoursitename.neocities.org url.

## I don't know how to make a good-looking website!

Yeah, neither do I, so steal! I'd advise using Jekyll to make the website (see the tutorial like under GitHub pages) and googling "Jekyll themes". There are many and lots of good-looking ones, please don't the one I stole.

### Why didn't you suggest x? It's better!

I probably don't know about it or it's too much effort. The above stuff should have you running a website in no time!
